# Global organized space for matching people based on purpose

## Problem statement

* Twitter is a central medium for people to say things. Since it’s a central medium, anyone can see what anyone else said, so you essentially have a global way for people to communicate - someone from Ethiopia can see what someone in Hawaii just said & answer him. You can follow people (or topics) that interest you & see what they say.

* It’s like a giant wall in which anyone in the world can write & read what everyone else wrote. Or you can think of it as a public square that anyone in the world can come to & talk with anyone else.

* It is so useful because it allows everyone in the world to use the same wall or public square, instead of the millions of local walls or squares in which people communicated before Twitter. Without a central wall or square the person in Ethiopia would probably never have heard & replied to what the person in Hawaii said.

* Communication is a crucial need, but there’s also a higher level need (at least in the Maslow hierarchy) - the need for self-actualization.

* It basically means that humans need to have a chance to realize their goals & dreams in order to feel that they achieved their purpose in life.

* Unfortunately, not many people can truly say they achieved their purpose & realized their goals & dreams.

* Back to the person in Ethiopia & the one in Hawaii, let’s assume that they both have the same purpose they’re passionate about, e.g., to fight global warming by planting millions of trees, or build a mobile app that assists people with certain mental or cognitive issues, or bake the most delicious bread or pastry in the world.

* Both of them are very passionate & self-driven about this purpose, but since they’re not aware of the fact that they both share the same purpose, they work on it alone & independently.

* When people work on some difficult goal alone, without organizing with other people to work together, the chances of success are extremely low.

* The way people organize to work together today, is either by raising funding & then paying others to help them, or by teaming up with other people driven by the same purpose & forming an organization together.

* However, it‘s quite difficult to find others with similar purpose, because most likely they’re not among your contacts, so it will take a miracle for you to somehow find each other & learn that you both share the same purpose or dream.


## Background: what is "Purpose"

* Humans, as most other things in the world, are complex machines. To understand the world, they usually need to build some machine, understand its inner working, & then use it as a metaphor to understand other machines in the world around them
        * When people were only able to build simple mechanical machines, they only understood the world as mechanical machines
        * When people were able to build steam engines, they understood the world as machines burning fuel to use its energy
        * When people were able to build machines based on software, they understood the world as information processing machines defined by self-reproducing code
* When trying to understand purpose, we can look at the most complex machines we are able to build, software systems, & try to see whether they manifest the concept of purpose
    * Software systems are written to help people achieve something.
        * I'm currently writing this using a software called FreeMind, whose purpose is to allow people express ideas more easily, by laying them out in a mindmap
        * The software was written for this sole purpose of helping people achieve something
* Applying this metaphor, the purpose of humans is the goal for which they were created, which most likely is to help their genes reproduce & spread as much as possible for the longest time
* Humans do seem to manifest this purpose: they are very driven to find the best-genes-carrying people to have children with & spread their genes so they'll have the best chances to further spread for the longest time
* The attributes by which humans estimate the quality of genes are usually beauty, position in hierarchy or money
* In nature, we see some cases where some animals create some artifact or presentation to demonstrate having good genes
        * For example, some birds build a structure using colorful objects they collect to impress other birds
* So, apparently there's a feature in their software that tries to achieve the primary purpose by following some sub-purpose, such as creating "art" that demonstrate the quality of their genes
        * Schubert, Kierkegaard & van-Gogh were never able to spread their genes, by they worked really hard on their art, which was the purpose driving them
* Yesterday, I was watching an art work created by an artist called Craig Mazin, the TV miniseries "Chernobyl", which was created in order to tell the unknown story of how people sacrificed themselves, took huge risk & fought the system to save their country & the whole continent
* This again shows the definition of purpose as the creation of great art   - beauty artifact - that shows the quality of the genes of the people who created it, but it also shows another kind of purpose
        * The people who sacrificed themselves for saving others show a purpose that's different than just spreading their genes
* Humans are community animals - they live in families, communities, cities & countries
* The primary purpose of reproducing their genes most successfully, probably takes into account that some of their genes are shared in their communities
* But you might also want to see the purpose on the level of the community as the real organism, as we understand other community animals such as ants & bees, where the queen is the reproducing organ, and the ants or bees are just cells in the larger creature, who will gladly sacrifice themselves to protect the community


## Solution overview

* We believe that the number of unique purposes in the world is smaller than the number of humans, so multiple people share the same purpose

* We think there’s a need for a central medium for listing the unique purposes in the world, & the people who embody them, so that people would be able to easily team up with others who share the same purpose

* We believe this central medium should be an organized space, using the process of purpose embedding, which ensures purposes are unique & also means that similar purposes will appear close to each other

* We believe you should be able to see the different people or teams working towards each purpose & the extent to which they were successful in achieving it

* & finally we believe that in order for an organization made of people with shared purpose to be effective, & in order for the people within it to be happy in their journey, they should all be equal partners & avoid having an hierarchy where some people manage others & tell them what to do.



## Using purpose-embedding to build a central medium for organizing people's work

* fromTeal asks users who join it about their purpose - what would they really love to work on
* It then applies a process of purpose-embedding (derived from sentence-embedding) to assign the purpose a vector in the space of entered purposes
* Based on this vector, it can lookup any existing purposes that are either identical or very similar to the given purpose
* If found, it asks the user to confirm that the purpose given is the same as the existing one
* Otherwise, it adds the given purpose to the space of entered purposes
* It then takes the user to the organized space of purposes, prepared by reducing the dimensions of purpose embeddings to 2 dimensions, which assigns every unique purpose an address in a WebWideMatrix floor
            * WebWideMatrix is a protocol for creating Organized Spaces rendered as a city of nested buildings, that users can enter & explore
            * You can read more about it here: https://dibau.wordpress.com/2018/05/12/buildings-a-new-metaphor-for-organizing-data-in-the-age-of-the-cloud/)
* The user can is assigned a building in the 1st floor of the purpose building
* On the floor, the user can see other individuals or teams that also work on that purpose
* The buildings for the different individuals or teams have different heights, reflecting the measured success they had in achieving the purpose
* Success is measured using a new cryptocurrency, called HelpingCoin, that  can be purchased by people impacted by the work of a certain individual or team, & paid to the individual or team. The more helpingCoin an individual or team earns, the more it is considered successful
* If you enter a building, you'll see in its 1st floor buildings for the different versions of the service or product or research that embody the work to achieve the purpose
* The height of these version buildings will also reflect their success
