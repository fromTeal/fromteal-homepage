## The fromTeal Project

Most of us spend the biggest part of our day at a place called work. We do things we don’t really want to be doing, following processes we don't really believe in, and stay mostly disengaged.

At fromTeal, we believe people long to bring something meaningful into the world. We believe that anyone can be an entrepreneur, build what’s calling them, and finally stop dreaming of the next life.

We are guided by two hypotheses:

1. We believe that the strongest possible driver in a person is purpose - creating what you feel called to create in the world. And...

2. Organizations are most effective when they run bottom-up, made of self-managed teams without an artificial hierarchy. If you've ever taken part in a hackathon, you probably experienced how effective, productive, creative, and joyful the work was. The reason: your team was building something you cared about, on your own terms, with full accountability and freedom for each team member. Ownership start to finish. 

Through our work, we are trying to create organizations that work like a hackathon team, all year round.

We’re doing this by building an online platform to help passionate people connect, create what they feel called to create, and make a living doing it. The platform will offer tools to build organic, bottom-up organizations - facilitating co-leadership, accountability, decision-making, compensation, team gratitude, and more.
